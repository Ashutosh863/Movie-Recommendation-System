  --> Movie Recommendation via Viewer Clustering

This project demonstrates a simple **movie recommendation system** using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).  
Instead of traditional collaborative filtering, it clusters users based on their viewing/rating patterns and recommends movies liked by similar viewers.

---

## Features
- Clusters users based on their movie ratings using **KMeans**.
- Uses **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and visualization of user clusters.
- Interactive **Streamlit app** for generating recommendations.
- Provides **top 10 movie recommendations** for any selected user.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   git clone <repo llink>
   cd movie-recommendation-clustering
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Example requirements.txt:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
streamlit
Download the MovieLens dataset (small version recommended for quick testing: ml-latest-small)
Place movies.csv and ratings.csv in the project directory.

Usage
1. Train Clustering Model
Run the preprocessing & clustering script:


python movie_clustering.py
This will:
Build the userâ€“movie rating matrix
Scale data
Perform PCA & KMeans clustering
Save models (scaler.pkl, kmeans.pkl, user_movie_matrix.pkl, movies.pkl)

Generate a cluster visualization (clusters.png)

2. Launch Streamlit App
Run the interactive app:

streamlit run app.py

How It Works
Select a User ID from the dropdown.

The system:
Scales the userâ€™s ratings
Predicts their cluster with KMeans
Finds similar users in the same cluster
Aggregates ratings from those users
Recommends the top 10 movies the selected user hasnâ€™t rated yet
The recommendations are displayed on the app interface.

ðŸ“Š Example Output
Cluster Visualization
Streamlit App
When you select a user, the app outputs recommendations like:

Top 10 Recommended Movies for User 12:
1. Toy Story (1995)
2. Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)
3. Pulp Fiction (1994)
...
Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
Machine Learning: KMeans, PCA

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Web App: Streamlit

ðŸ“Œ Notes
This is a basic recommendation system â€” it doesnâ€™t yet use advanced collaborative filtering or deep learning.

For larger datasets, you may want to optimize memory usage (e.g., using sparse matrices).
